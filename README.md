================

The source of the [soupault.app](https://soupault.app) website.

If you want to play with it to learn how it works and build a local copy,
you will need Soupault v4.0.0-beta1 or newer and the following external tools:

* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) for Markdown processing.
* [highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php) for syntax highlighting.

When you have those installed, run `make all`.
