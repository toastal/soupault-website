  <li>For using soupault as an <a href="/tips-and-tricks/getting-started-html-processor">HTML processor</a> for existing websites.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="processor-mode">Do I need to change my website to start using soupault?</h3>
<p>
No. With many other website generators, you need to create a theme/template in their
own format to start using them. Soupault can work as an HTML processor for existing
websites, so it&apos;s much easier to give it a try.
</p>
<p>
Note that soupault never modifies any files in place, it always reads pages from one directory
and outputs processed pages to another. It&apos;s thus safe to point at handwritten pages.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to try it is to <a href="#project-setup">initialize a project</a>,
copy your pages to the <code>site</code> directory and edit the config (<code>soupault.conf</code>).
Then just run <code>soupault</code> in that directory.
</p>
Soupault knows if a file is a complete page or a page body, and doesn&apos;t use a template for
complete pages, so the pages will not be messed up. This can be used for <a href="#unique-layout">mixing unique and templated
pages</a> too.
</p>

<h3 id="project-setup">How to set up a basic project</h3>
<p>
Run <code>soupault --init</code> in an empty directory. It will create the following directory structure and files:
</p>
<pre>
.
├── site
│   └── index.html
├── soupault.conf
└── templates
    └── main.html
</pre>
<p>
The <code>site/</code> directory is where your page content files go. The <code>templates/main.html</code> is
the page template. The <code>soupault.conf</code> file is the configuration file for soupault, in the TOML format.
</p>
<p>
If you run <code>soupault</code> in that directory, it will build your website and place the processed pages in
the <code>build/</code> directory. You can then deploy your website with any tool of your choice, like
<code>neocities push</code>, rsync, or anything else.
</p>

<h3 id="no-project-dir">Do I need to keep everything in one directory?</h3>
<p>
No. It makes things easier, but it&apos;s not required. By default, soupault will look for <code>soupault.conf</code>
in the current working directory and read it. From there it will take the <code>site_dir</code> and <code>build_dir</code>
options. You can use absolute paths for those options.
<p>
You can also override the locations of the config file
and the source/output directories from the command line. A UNIX example of overriding everything at once:
</p>
<pre>
SOUPAULT_CONFIG="something.conf" soupault --site-dir some-input-dir --build-dir some-other-dir
</pre>
<p>
On Windows, there&apos;s no easy way to set an environment variable for a command like that,
but you can make a batch script or just keep the config file in a parent directory and call soupault from there.
The <code>--site-dir</code> and <code>--build-dir</code> options work the same on all platforms.
</p>

<h3 id="assets">How to add assets (pictures, CSS, etc.)</h3>
<p>
You can just drop files in the <code>site/</code> directory together with pages. Files with extensions
matching the <code>page_file_extensions</code> are considered pages and processed, by default that&apos;s
<code>["html", "htm", "md", "rst", "adoc"]</code>. All other files are just copied to the <code>build/</code>
directory unchanged.
</p>

<h3 id="sections">How to create a site section</h3>

<p>
Just create a subdirectory in <code>site/</code>. Every subdirectory automatically becomes a section,
e.g. <code>site/pictures/cats.html</code> becomes <code>build/pictures/cats/index.html</code> if clean URLs
are enabled, or <code>build/pictures/cats.html</code> if they are disabled.
</p>
<p>
They can be nested as deep as you want, there is no depth limit. However, section index pages is your responsibility,
so if you want <code>https://example.com/pictures</code> to work, you should also add <code>site/pictures/index.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
Soupault can be configured to generate a list of all pages in a section, but there still must be a section index page,
whether you are maintaining a list of pages in the section by hand or using a script to generate it.
</p>

<h3 id="clean-urls">How to disable clean URLs</h3>
<p>
Soupault uses &ldquo;clean URLs&rdquo; by default. This means a page like <code>site/about.html</code>
turns into <code>build/about/index.html</code>, so that on deployed website it can be accessed as
<code>http://example.com/about</code>.
<p>
<p>
For a new website, the choice between <code>/about/</code> and <code>/about.html</code> is purely aesthetic,
but for people who already have a website and want to switch to managing it with soupault, it can be a real
show stopper since it can break all their links. For this reason, soupault has a <code>clean_urls</code>
option. Use <code>clean_urls = false</code> if you want to disable it.
</p>
<p>
With <code>clean_urls = false</code>, soupault preserves file names exactly, e.g. <code>site/about.htm</code>
becomes <code>build/about.htm</code>, and <code>site/projects/soupault.html</code> becomes
<code>build/projects/soupault.html</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="building">Building your site from pieces</h2>

<h3 id="content-selector">Where the page content goes</h3>
<p>
When soupault builds your website, it takes the empty page template from <code>templates/main.html</code>,
reads content from files in <code>site/</code> such as <code>site/about.html</code>, and inserts it in the template.
</p>
<p>
By default, it will insert the page content into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of the page template.
</p>
<p>
However, you can insert page content into any element using the <code>content_selector</code> option
in the <code>[settings]</code> section.
Suppose you want your page content to go to <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code>. Then add that div
to <code>templates/main.html</code>, find that option in <code>soupault.conf</code>,
and set it to <code>content_selector = "div#content"</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="unique-layout">How to create a page with unique layout</h3>
<p>
Using a template saves time and allows easily changing the website layout. However, what if you want to make a page
with a unique layout different from the template?
</p>
<p>
Soupault decides whether to use a template or not by checking if a page file has an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in it.
It it does not have it, then the file is considered a page body and inserted in the template. If it does, then it&apos;s considered
a complete page and only processed by widgets/plugins.
</p>
<p>
So, to make a unique page, just make it a complete HTML document.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to exclude it from some widgets using the <code>exclude_page</code> option.
</p>

<h3 id="include-file">How to include external files in pages</h3>
<p>
Suppose all your pages have the same header and footer, and you want to keep them in separate files,
e.g. <code>templates/header.html</code> and <code>templates/footer.html</code>. Suppose your header should be in a
<code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code> and the footer should be in the <code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
First, add <code>div</code>&apos;s with those ids to your <code>templates/main.html</code>.
Then add this to your <code>soupault.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.header]
  widget = "include"
  selector = "div#header"
  file = "templates/header.html"

[widgets.footer]
  widget = "include"
  selector = "div#footer"
  file = "templates/footer.html"  
</pre>

<h3 id="include-html">How to insert an HTML snippet</h3>

<p>
Sometimes you just need a small snippet that makes no sense to keep in a separate file.
Suppose you want to add an analytics script to your pages, just one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag
in the head. You can do it like this:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.analytics-script]
  widget = "insert_html"
  selector = "head"
  html = '&lt;script src="/scripts/evil-analytics.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;'
</pre>

<h2 id="enhancing">Enhancing your pages</h2>

<h3 id="set-title">How to automatically set page title</h3>
<p>
A website where every page has the same <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is a sad sight.
Soupault can set the page title from an element of your choice. This is the config
for this page, that takes the title from an element with <code>id="title"</code>.
In this page it&apos;s a <code>h1</code>, but it could be anything.
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.page-title]
  widget = "title"
  selector = "#title"
  default = "soupault"
  append = " &mdash; soupault"
</pre>

<h3 id="toc">How to add a table of contents</h3>
<p>
Soupault can automatically generate tables of contents from heading tags.
This is the config for this very page:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.table-of-contents]
  widget = "toc"
  selector = "#generated-toc"

  min_level = 2

  toc_list_class = "toc"
  toc_class_levels = false

  numbered_list = true

  heading_links = true
  heading_link_text = "→ "
  heading_link_class = "here"

  use_heading_slug = true
</pre>
<p>
Remember to add a <code>&lt;div id="generated-toc"&gt;</code> to <code>templates/main.html</code>
if you want a ToC in every page, or just to pages where you want it.
</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">How to add footnotes</h3>
<p>
If you like footnotes, you can add them to your pages easily. This is the config for this website:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.footnotes]
  widget = "footnotes"
  selector = "div#footnotes"
  footnote_selector = ".footnote"
  footnote_link_class = "footnote"
  back_links = true
  link_id_prepend = "footnote-"
  back_link_id_append = "-ref"
</pre>
<p>
It assumes that there&apos;s a <code>&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;</code> in the page.
If you forget to include it in the page, footnotes will not appear.
</p>
<p>
It considers elements with <code>class="footnote"</code> footnotes and moves them
to that div. The <code>back_links</code> option creates links back from footnotes
to their original location, you can set it to <code>false</code> if you don&apos;t like
those links back.
</p>

<h2 id="extending">Extending soupault&apos;s capabilities</h2>

<h3 id="preprocessors">How to use Markdown and other formats</h3>
<p>
Unlike many other static website generators, soupault treats HTML as a first-class citizen.
In fact, it&apos;s the only format it treats that way, there&apos;s no built-in support for any other
format. If you are switching from another generator like Jekyll, or simply want to use Markdown
for some pages that don&apos;t need advanced markup, it can be quite limiting though.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that you can write pages in any format as long as you have a program that converts
it to HTML. You just need to specify a preprocessor program for a file extension, and soupault
will call it automatically.
</p>
<p>
For Markdown, I suggest the <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a> program.
On GNU/Linux you can install it from repositories and on macOS you can get it from
<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmark">homebrew</a>. I couldn&apos;t find a prebuilt version
for Windows though, so I made one (v.0.29.0): <a href="/files/cmark.exe">cmark.exe</a>.
To use it, just add this to your <code>soupault.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre>
[preprocessors]
  md = "cmark"
</pre>
<p>
Make sure the program is in your <code>PATH</code>. If it&apos;s not, you can specify an absolute path there,
like <code>md = '/opt/cmark/bin/cmark'</code> or <code>md = 'C:\cmark\cmark.exe'</code>.
</p>
<p>
You can specify preprocessors for as many extensions as you want, so you can easily use multiple formats
at once.
</p>

<h2 id="edge-cases">Edge cases</h2>

<h3 id="page-section-collision">What happens if you have a directory and a page with the same name</h3>
<p>
Don&apos;t do it. It&apos;s undefined behaviour and anything may happen.
</p>
<p>
In the current versions, if you have clean URLs enabled and there are both <code>site/test.html</code>
and <code>site/test/index.html</code>, then the latter will be used. But it just happens to be this way
and may change any time, so don&apos;t count on it.
</p>
