# Support and discussion

## Discussion channels

If you have a question or an idea to discuss, there are two places.

For asynchronous communication there’s a [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~dmbaturin/soupault) on SourceHut.
Send your messages to <a href="mailto:~dmbaturin/soupault@lists.sr.ht">~dmbaturin/soupault@lists.sr.ht</a>.

For ‘real-time’ communication there’s `#soupault` IRC channel on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).
Note that the channel is very small so far and there are the usual timezone issues, so you may have to wait for a reply.

## Contacting the maintainer

Soupault’s maintainer is [Daniil Baturin](https://www.baturin.org).

If you have a question about soupault that you don’t want to ask in public, you can message him at `daniil+soupault@baturin.org`.

## Commercial support

If you want commercial support, consulting, help with migration from other tools, or some other service,
feel free to contact the maintainer.
