<h1 id="post-title">Making section indices and blogs</h1>

<span>Last update: <time>2019-12-05</time><span>
<p>
This website and the blog are made with soupault, quite obviously. How exactly the blog is made?
While soupault doesn&apos;t include any blog functionality, it allows you to extract metadata from existing pages
and either render it using a built-in index generator or feed it to an external script.
</p>
<p>
Please note that if you want a full-grown blog with tags, archives searchable by date and so on,
you should better use a specialized blog generator like <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>.
You can reimplement that functionality in a soupault workflow, but it may be more trouble than it&apos;s worth.
</p>
<p>
The indexing feature is there to simplify creating and maintaining lists of all pages
in a site section, and it&apos;s also good for simple blogs, but it only gives you the index data,
and what you do with that data is up to you. 
</p>
<h2>How indexing works in soupault?</h2>
<p>
Since soupault works on the element tree of the page rather than its text, it can extract content from
specific elements. For example, the first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> of a page is usually its title.
The first paragraph is often (though not always) written to give the reader a summary of the page,
and makes a good abstract/excerpt. Their content can be extracted using CSS selectors like <code>h1</code>
and <code>p</code> (or something more specific like <code>main p</code>, if you want the first paragraph
inside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element).
</p>
<p>
This way you can make use of your existing site structure to automatically create an index for it,
rather than have to extract and duplicate all metadata.
</p>
<p>
In a classic static site generator, a post would be preceded by &ldquo;front matter&rdquo;: a metadata section that generator uses to create both the final page
and its blog feed entry, something like:
</p>
<pre class="language-yaml">
---
title: Why soupault?
date: 2019-10-10
---
There are many…
</pre>
<p>
There is nothing like it in my blog. The key idea of soupault is to work on existing HTML, so those posts are valid bodies
of complete pages, not just a raw material for the generator. Other SSGs generate HTML, while soupault transforms and enhances it.
</p>
<p>
Let&apos;s examine the beginning of the <a href="https://github.com/dmbaturin/soupault.neocities.org/blob/master/site/blog/why-soupault.html">first blog entry</a>:
</p>
<pre class="language-html">
&lt;h1 id="post-title"&gt;Why soupault?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Date: &lt;time id="post-date"&gt;2019-10-10&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="post-excerpt"&gt;
There are so many static site generators already that another one needs a pretty good justification.
I mainly made soupault for my own use, in fact it has grown out of a set of custom scripts that used to power
the &lt;a href="https://baturin.org"&gt;baturin.org&lt;/a&gt; website. Still, if I&apos;m making it public, I may as well want to
explain the decisions behing it and reasons why anyone else may want to use it.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
That&apos;s just normal HTML. However, you see there are some element ids that are not strictly necessary, like <code>id="post-date"</code>. On my website,
there are no special styles for those elements. They serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat">microformat</a>
that tells soupault what exactly to extract from the page to create its blog feed entry. Of course, they could also be used for styling
or as page anchors.
</p>
<p>
Now let&apos;s see how the blog feed is created from those pages. First, w&apos;ll examine the <code>[index]</code> section from my <code>soupault.conf</code>.
This is a slightly simplified version of it that you can easily copy into your config:
</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
[index]
  index = true
  index_selector = "#blog-index"

  index_title_selector = ["h1#post-title", "h1"]
  index_date_selector = ["time#post-date", "time"]
  index_excerpt_selector = ["p#post-excerpt", "p"]

  newest_entries_first = true

  index_item_template = """
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="{{url}}"&gt;{{title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last update:&lt;/strong&gt; {{date}}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{{excerpt}}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="{{url}}"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;
"""
</pre>
<p>
In short, it tells soupault what to extract, how to render the index, and where to extract it.
</p>
<p>
First of all, don&apos;t forget the <code>index = true</code> option. Index data extraction is disabled
by default, so you need to enable it if you want to use it.
</p>
<p>
The <code>index_selector</code> option is a CSS selector of the element where generated
index is inserted.
In my <code>site/blog/index.html</code> it&apos;s a <code>&lt;div id="blog-index"&gt;</code>,
so it can be uniquely identified with <code>#blog-index</code>. This is equivalent to <code>$("#blog-index")</code>
in jQuery or <code>getElementById("blog-index")</code> in plain JS.
</p>
<p>
The <code>index_title_selector</code>, <code>index_date_selector</code>, and <code>index_excerpt_selector</code>
options tell soupault what to extract. Notice that there are multiple selectors for each of them.
For example, <code>index_excerpt_selector = ["p#post-excerpt", "p"]</code> means &ldquo;extract data from a <code>&lt;p id="post-excerpt"&gt;</code>
if it exists, otherwise, extract the first paragraph&rdquo;. This makes it possible to use something else than the first paragraph
for the post excerpt, without duplicating the data. I can just mark the excerpt paragraph explicitly with an <code>id</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>
The <code>newest_entries_first</code> tells soupault to sort entries by date in descending order. The default date format is
<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, though it&apos;s configurable. It uses the date extracted by the <code>index_date_selector</code> option.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there&apos;s a <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> template used for rendering index entries. This is supported since version 1.6.
Mustache is a simple, logicless template language that should cover the basics. You can read about available fields and other details in the
<a href="/reference-manual/#indexing">reference manual</a>.
</p>
<h2>Using external index processors</h2>
<p>
The built-in index generator is fast and easy to use, but it&apos;s not very flexible. However, soupault can export extracted data and feed it to an
external script, then include its output back in the page. This way you can do literally <em>anything</em> with that data, though it requires
some programming skill (on the other hand, it can be a good first project for learning programming).
</p>
<p>Index data is encoded in JSON and sent to the script&apos;s input (<code>stdin</code>):</p>
<pre class="language-json">
[
  {
    "nav_path": ["blog"],
    "url": "/blog/blogs-and-section-indices",
    "title": "Making section indices and blogs",
    "date": "2019-10-11",
    "author": null,
    "excerpt": "\nThis website and the blog are made with soupault, quite obviously…"
  },
  {
    "nav_path": ["blog"],
    "url": "/blog/why-soupault",
    "title": "Why soupault?",
    "date": "2019-10-10",
    "author": null,
    "excerpt": "\nThere are so many static site generators already…"
  }
]
</pre>
<p>
I reformatted it for better readability and shortened the excerpts. In reality it&apos;s sent as a single line with a newline character
as an end of input marker, and the full text of excerpt is included.
</p>
<p>This is how we could reimplement what my setup does using a <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> script:</p>
<pre class="language-python">
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import json
import pystache

template = """
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="{{url}}"&gt;{{title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last update: {{date}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{{excerpt}}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="{{url}}"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;
"""

renderer = pystache.Renderer()

input = sys.stdin.readline()
index_entries = json.loads(input)

for entry in index_entries:
    print(renderer.render(template, entry))
</pre>
<p>
How to make soupault run that script? Suppose you saved it to <code>scripts/index.py</code>. Then instead of the <code>index_item_template</code> option,
you need to add <code>index_processor = "scripts/index.py"</code>.
</p>
<p>
On UNIX-like systems, don&apos;t forget to make it executable (<kbd>chmod +x scripts/index.py</kbd>).
On Windows, you should make sure <code>.py</code> files are associated with Python and you also need to adjust the path (see below).
</p>

<h3>A note for Windows users</h3>
<p>
Soupault uses native file path syntax on every OS, so for you the script option will be <code>index_processor = 'scripts\index.py'</code>.
Note the single quotes! Inside double quotes, the back slash is an escape character that can be used for inserting special characters inside your strings
(like <code>"\n"</code>, the newline character). Inside single quotes it has no special meaning.
</p>

<h2>If that is not enough</h2>
<p>
This is a simple blog recipe that is easy to copy. However, there are more features that add flexibility. First, soupault is not limited
to those built-in fields, you can define your own fields with their names and selectors, and they will be available to the built-in templates
and external scripts alike. Second, it can dump the complete site index data to a JSON file that you can use to create taxonomies etc.
That&apos;s for another time though.
