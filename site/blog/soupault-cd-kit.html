It was once common for open source projects to sell CDs to make some money and help
people with slow Internet connections to get the software. Fast and cheap Internet access made
physical media obsolete, but I&apos;m pretty sure some people miss classic distribution methods.
Of course it would be impractical to make and sell CDs, but now you can make your very own
soupault CD with a DIY CD kit. It includes printable keep case cover and CD label,
so all you need is a blank CD, color printer, and scissors.

I have also prepared an <a href="/files/soupault-1.10.iso">ISO image</a> that includes soupault 1.10
release, source code bundled with all its dependencies, a copy of the reference manual,
and a collection of plugins.
