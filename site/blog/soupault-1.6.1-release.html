<p id="post-excerpt">
Soupault 1.6.1 is a small maintenance release that fixes an issue with <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags inside
includes and HTML snippets used by <code>include</code> and <code>insert_html</code> widgets. Those tags are now parsed correctly.
You can download the updated executables from <a hred="https://files.baturin.org/software/soupault/1.6.1/">files.baturin.org/software/soupault/1.6.1/</a>
or install from opam.
</p>
<p>A typical use case for it is like:<p>

<pre class="raw-html">
<script src='arcanoid.js'></script>
<noscript>Enable JavaScript to play the game</noscript>
</pre>

<p>
Soupault&apos;s HTML parser <a href="https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/issues/48">incorrectly assumed</a> that noscript tags are only allowed in the page head and made a misguided attempt
to correct the snippet by inserting a body element in it. That would result in a page with one body element nested in another. The maintainer resolved the issue quickly,
and now snippets for analytics services etc. should just work.

<p>
An interesting fact for geeks is that Windows binaries are now built on a GNU/Linux host, using MinGW binutils and the OCaml cross-toolchain.
While OCaml tools make cross-compilation dead simple, you still need cross-versions of every library your project uses, and
the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows">opam-cross-windows</a> repository has been lacking, so I&apos;d have
to cross-compile everything locally. Instead, I took time to package the missing libs for opam-cross-windows, so when the pull requests
are verified and merged, everyone will be able to build a Windows version with just <code>dune build -x windows</code> on an all free software system.
