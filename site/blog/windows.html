<h1 id="post-title">Using soupault on Windows</h1>

I don&apos;t use Windows myself. There are, however, many people who do, and I want to make my programs
available to them. I tried to make soupault work on Windows exactly like it works on UNIX,
and all functionality is available there, with only a few minor differences you should be aware of.
If you are not using any preprocessors or external scripts, same configs should work on all systems
without adjustments.
</p>
<p>
First, a video demonstration that it indeed does work. It&apos;s a Windows 7 test VM, with
Python installed, for the blog index generator script, and for the web server module that I use for testing.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>
Of course, it&apos;s a rather basic support and soupault hardly feels like a native Windows program.
If you have ideas for improving its usability, please share (Shell integrations? Editor integrations? An actual installer?
Something else?).
</p>
<p>
Now to the point. One notable difference is that Windows uses the back slash as a filesystem path
separator. The good thing is that <em>most of the time</em> you can use the UNIX convention.
The only places where you can&apos;t are the <a href="/reference-manual/#using-external-index-generators">index_processor</a> option,
<a href="/reference-manual/#page-preprocessors">preprocessor options</a>, and the <code>command</code>
of the <a href="/reference-manual/#widgets-exec">exec</a> widget.
</p>
<p>
Wherever the path is only interpreted by soupault itself, you can just copy examples from this blog or the documentation
unchanged. This will work on all systems:
</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
[settings]
  default_template = 'templates/main.html'

[widgets.footer]
  widget = 'include'
  file = 'templates/footer.html'
  selector = 'body'
</pre>
<p>
Paths to executables, however, are passed to the system shell (<code>cmd.exe /s</code> on Windows), so they must follow
the right convention for the OS. This is why you need to write them like this:
</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
[index]
  index_processor = 'scripts\index.py'

[preprocessors]
  md = 'C:\cmark\cmark.exe'

[widgets.some-script]
  widget = 'exec'
  command = 'scripts\myscript.bat'
  selector = 'body'
</pre>
<p>
You should also note that inside double quotes, the back slash is an escape character<span class="footnote" id="escape">It allows
you to insert special characters inside strings, e.g. <code>\n</code> is newline.</span>, so you need to either use single quotes
(<code>command = 'scripts\myscript.bat'</code>), or use a double back slash (<code>command = "scripts\\myscript.bat"</code>).
</p>
